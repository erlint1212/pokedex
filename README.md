# Pokedex

## Guided project from boot.dev [https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli](Link)

### Description

Build a REPL pokedex on the command line in Go. Learn how to use JSON, make network requests, and implement caching.

A REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop, is a simple interactive programming environment that takes user input, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user. In this guided project, you'll build a Pokedex-like REPL in Go that uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokemon. It's a great way to put your Go knowledge to the test and learn valuable skills like HTTP networking and data serialization.

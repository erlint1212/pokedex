# Pokedex

## Guided project from boot.dev [link](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli)

### Description

Build a REPL pokedex on the command line in Go. Learn how to use JSON, make network requests, and implement caching.

A REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop, is a simple interactive programming environment that takes user input, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user. In this guided project, you'll build a Pokedex-like REPL in Go that uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokemon. It's a great way to put your Go knowledge to the test and learn valuable skills like HTTP networking and data serialization.

### Learning goals

* Learn how to parse JSON in Go
* Practice making HTTP requests in Go
* Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
* Get hands-on practice with local Go development and tooling
* Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance

### Improvements

* Make it so cache and API functions only send relevant information instead of the whole API response, memory efficency.
